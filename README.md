# Makemore-2
This Colab notebook implements a character-level language model in PyTorch. It reads a names.txt dataset, builds a vocabulary, and trains a neural network to predict the next character in a sequence. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and generating new names, with visualizations of character embeddings.
